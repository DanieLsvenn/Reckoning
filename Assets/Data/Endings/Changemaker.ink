You spent your life piecing together the shattered fragments of the world — war, hatred, hunger. 
You wished not only to change yourself, but to heal all that surrounded you. You endured suffering so that others might feel less of it. You became an inventor, a negotiator, an artist. 
Perhaps the horrors you once witnessed were what gave you the will to mend them.
A beautiful dream… and yet, it was only ever a dream.
