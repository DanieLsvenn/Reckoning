You are everything you once despised â€” and you embrace it.
You accept the rot within yourself, because you understand: this world is no temple, but a landfill, a heaven for decay. Humanity itself is the demon it fears the most. Death, for you, would be a kind of mercy.
Gratitude? To whom would you offer it now?
Do you still believe in God?
