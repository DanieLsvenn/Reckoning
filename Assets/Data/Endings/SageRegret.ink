And yet, somewhere deep within the hollow cathedral of your chest, something is missing
A black sun devouring all warmth, all hunger, all trace of self. 
The words that leave your lips ring empty, like sermons to a god long gone. 
Emptiness in speech, emptiness in your lessons, emptiness in the soul that preaches them.
O Lordâ€¦ is this what You call redemption, or punishment?
